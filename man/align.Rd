\title{Aligns together either a single drug regimen/record, or a list of regimens against a drug record,
returning either a set of global alignments or a set of local alignments, either overlapping
or otherwise}
\usage{
align(regimen, regName, drugRec, g, Tfac, s = NA, verbose = 0, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{regimen}{A sequence to be aligned, usually a short sequence defining a chemotherapy regimen,
may contain multiple regimens if supplied as a list}

\item{regName}{The name of the supplied regimen/s, may be a character or a list}

\item{drugRec}{A longer sequence to be aligned, usually a patient's converted drug occurrence table}

\item{g}{A gap penalty supplied to the temporal needleman wunsch/smith waterman algorithms}

\item{Tfac}{The time penalty factor. All time penalties are calculated as a percentage of Tfac}

\item{s}{A substituion matrix, either user-defined or derived from defaultSmatrix. Will be auto-generated if left blank.}

\item{verbose}{A variable indicating how verbose the python script should be in reporting results
Verbose = 0 : Print nothing
Verbose = 1 : Print seqs and scores
Verbose = 2 : Report seqs, scores, H and traceMat}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which loss function method to utilise. Please pick one of
PropDiff        - Proportional difference of Tx and Ty
AbsDiff         - Absolute difference of Tx and Ty
Quadratic       - Absolute difference of Tx and Ty to the power 2
PropQuadratic   - Absolute difference of Tx and Ty to the power 2, divided by the max of Tx and Ty
LogCosh         - The natural logarithm of the Cosh of the absolute difference of Tx and Ty}
}
\value{
dat A dataframe containing information on the resulting alignments
output <- align(regimen,drugRec)
}
