For the version of this package which uses DatabaseConnector, please change branches to ["DatabaseConnector"](https://github.com/OdyOSG/ARTEMIS/tree/DatabaseConnector).


## Overview

ARTEMIS provides an interface for utilizing a modified Temporal Smith-Waterman (TSW) algorithm, derived from [10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344785](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292331949_Temporal_Needleman-Wunsch), to summarize longitudinal EHR data into discrete regimen eras. Primarily intended to be used for cancer patients, ARTEMIS utilizes data derived from the [HemOnc](https://hemonc.org/wiki/Main_Page) oncology reference to form the basic regimen data used in testing.

## Features

ARTEMIS is primarily useful for stratifying patients based on their most likely prescribed regimens, for use in cohort construction via the Episode Era table of the [OMOP CDM](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/).

ARTEMIS may also be used for providing summary statistics on the number and distribution of regimens found within a specific cohort, as well as their coverage and length, as well as providing summary graphics for patient treatment trajectories.

## Installation

ARTEMIS can presently be installed directly from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("odyOSG/ARTEMIS")
```

ARTEMIS relies on a python back-end via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) and depending on your reticulate settings, system and environment, you may need to run the following commands before loading the package:

``` r
#reticulate::py_install("numpy")
#reticulate::py_install("pandas")
```

If you do not presently have reticulate or python3.11 installed you may first need to run the following commands to ensure that reticulate can access a valid python install on your system:

``` r
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

This will prompt reticulate to install python, create a local virtualenv called "r-reticulate" and finally set that as the local virtual environment for use when running python via R.


## Usage

### CDMConnector

ARTEMIS also relies on the package [CDMConnector](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/) to create a connection to your CDM from any valid DBI connection. The process of cohort creation requires that you have a valid data-containing schema, and a pre-existing schema where you have write access. This write schema will be used to store cohort tables during their generation, and may be safely deleted after running the package.

The specific drivers required by dbConnect may change depending on your system. More detailed information can be found in the section "DBI Drivers" at the bottom of this readme.

If the OHDSI package [CirceR](https://github.com/OHDSI/CirceR) is not already installed on your system, you may need to directly install this from the OHDSI/CirceR github page, as this is a non-CRAN dependency required by CDMConnector.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dbiconn <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Redshift(),
                          dbname = "dbName",
                          host = "hostName",
                          port = "9999",
                          user = "user",
                          password = "password")

cdmSchema      <- "schema_containing_data"

cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_con(con = dbiconn,
                                  cdm_schema = cdmSchema,
                                  write_schema = "schema_with_write_access")

```

### Input

An input JSON containing a cohort specification is input by the user. Information on OHDSI cohort creation and best practices can be found [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/Cohorts.html).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

json <- loadCohort()
name <- "examplecohort"

#Manual
#json <- CDMConnector::readCohortSet(path = here::here("myCohort/"))
#name <- "customcohort"

```

Regimen data may be read in from the provided package, or may be submitted directly by the user. All of the provided regimens will be tested against all patients within a given cohort.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

regimens <- loadRegimens(condition = "lungCancer")

#Manual
#regimens <- read.csv(here::here("data/myRegimens.csv"))

```

A set of valid drugs may also be read in using the provided data, or may be curated and submitted by the user. Only valid drugs will appear in processed patient strings.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

validDrugs <- loadDrugs()

#Manual
#validDrugs <- read.csv(here::here("data/myDrugs.csv"))

```

### Pipeline

The cdm connection is used to generate a dataframe containing the relevant patient details for constructing regimen strings.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

con_df <- getCohortSet(cdm = cdm, json = json, name = name)

```

Regimen strings are then constructed, collated and filtered into a stringDF dataframe containing all patients of interest.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

stringDF <- stringDF_from_cdm(con_df = con_df, writeOut = F, validDrugs = validDrugs)

```

The TSW algorithm is then run using user input settings and the provided regimen and patient data. Detailed information on user inputs, such as the gap penalty, g, can be found [here](www.github.com/odyOSG/ARTEMIS)

```{r, eval=FALSE}

output_all <- stringDF %>% generateRawAlignments(regimens = regimens,
                                                 g = 0.4,
                                                 Tfac = 0.5,
                                                 verbose = 0,
                                                 mem = -1,
                                                 removeOverlap = 1,
                                                 method = "PropDiff")

```

Raw output alignments are then post-processed and may be visualised. Post-processing steps include the handling and combination of overlapping regimen alignments, as well as formatting output for submission to an episode era table.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

processedAll <- output_all %>% processAlignments(regimenCombine = 28, regimens = regimens)

personOfInterest <- output_all[output_all$personID == unique(output_all$personID)[1337],]

plotOutput(personOfInterest, fontSize = 2.5)

```

Data may then be further explored via several graphics which indicate various information, such as regimen frequency or the score/length distributions of a given regimen.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

plotFrequency(processedAll)

plotScoreDistribution(regimen1 = "Acetaminophen Monotherapy", regimen2 = "Ibuprofen Monotherapy", processedAll = processedAll)

plotRegimenLengthDistribution(regimen1 = "Acetaminophen Monotherapy", regimen2 = "Ibuprofen Monotherapy", processedAll = processedAll)

```

Treatment trajectories, or regimen eras, can then be calculated, adding further information about the relative sequencing order of different regimens and regimen types.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

processedEras <- processedAll %>% calculateEras(discontinuationTime = 90)

regStats <- processedEras %>% generateRegimenStats()

regStats[,-c(4,7)]

```

And resulting graphics, such as a sankey indicating the overall patterns of treatment trajectories can then be constructed. plotSankey() produces both a saved .png as well as an interactable .html of the created network graph.

You may need to run webshot::install_phantomjs() if your system does not already have it installed to utilise the Sankey package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

plotErasFrequency(processedEras)

#Potential dependency install:
#webshot::install_phantomjs()

regimen_Groups <- loadGroups()
plotSankey(processedEras, regimen_Groups)

```

### Output

Finally, a set of outputs may be produced and written into a local file using the writeOutputs() function. No patient IDs are written as outputs, with anonymised random IDs being used in their place. Both writeOuputs() and plotSankey() produce outputs that are automatically saved to the local working directory.

writeOutputs also produces data about the underlying cohorts used to construct the regimen outputs, and so also requires a call to the cdm directly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

writeOutputs(output_all = output_all, output_processed = processedAll, output_eras = processedEras,
            cdm = cdm, con_df = con_df, regGroups = regimen_Groups,
            regStats = regStats, stringDF = stringDF)

```
